This is a port of all the Miranda code from the 1992 publication of
‘Implementing Functional Languages’ by Simon Peyton Jones and David
Lester. The code is ported to Haskell.

The code is tagged based on each section of the book: if you have
finished reading the section 1.5.4 of the book and would like to see
what the code looks like and to play around with it, you would check
out the ‘1.5.4’ tag. I will try my best to solve all the exercises
that result in code needed to progress in the book.

Please note that only sections with code changes will be tagged: if
section 1.1.4 didn't have any changes in it, it will not be tagged.
